# Annotated bibliography for a language‑agnostic course on software library design

## What this bibliography is optimised for

Your syllabus treats a software library as a long‑lived, reusable product with explicit _contracts_ (APIs), clear domain
boundaries, compositional design, and a lifecycle that includes automation/build, testing as progressive assurance,
publishing/versioning, and ecosystem evolution. That implies a bibliography that balances:

- **Foundational design and modularity** (modules, information hiding, abstract data types, contracts)
- **Domain modelling and boundaries** (DDD vocabulary, contexts, invariants, separation of concerns)
- **API design and evolution** (expressiveness, mis‑use prevention, compatibility, breaking changes, deprecation)
- **Assurance and automation** (testing ladders including PBT/mutation/contract testing; build systems; CI/CD;
  reproducibility)
- **Execution in the real world** (reliability, operability, evolution over time)

To keep the bibliography resilient to language/toolchain churn, I prioritised sources that are either (a)
language‑agnostic by design, or (b) illustrate principles that generalise across ecosystems (e.g.,
contracts/specifications, modularity, compatibility management), using primary bibliographic “anchors” from publisher
catalogues and major scholarly indexes such as entity["organization","ACM Digital Library","acm publications index"],
entity["organization","IEEE","professional association"] venues, entity["organization","SpringerLink","springer
publishing platform"], and entity["organization","arXiv","open preprint repository"].

public‑contract framing. citeturn2search6

## How the bibliography covers the transversal axes

Your two transversal axes (testing progression; build systems as evolution support) can be explicitly “stitched” from
the B‑ and P‑sets without tying the course to a specific stack.

For the **testing progression**, the bibliography provides research and practice anchors for each stage:

- **BDD as shared language and acceptance focus** is covered via the original “Introducing BDD” articulation (useful
  historically and conceptually), and can be reinforced with your specification‑centric workflow using B‑level texts
  that emphasise specification/test alignment. citeturn8search0turn1search7
- **Design‑by‑contract and invariants** are supported both as a discipline (P3) and as a broader component‑construction
  approach (B5), mapping cleanly to “contracts early, properties later.” citeturn8search2turn7search27
- **Mocking and isolation of collaborators** is strongly treated in B12, which is explicitly about the symbiosis between
  test‑driven design and object design. citeturn8search9
- **Property‑based testing** has a canonical research foundation (P6) and deeper “types imply laws” support (P7),
  aligning directly to your Unidad 4 notion of composition laws and invariants. citeturn0search2turn9search29
- **Mutation testing** is supported by a high‑citation survey (P9) you can treat as the capstone “how strong is our test
  suite, really?” lens. citeturn2search3
- **Contract testing** for extension points and integration surfaces is supported by case‑study literature on
  consumer‑driven contract testing in microservices contexts, giving a concrete “replace flaky integration tests with
  stable contracts” argument you can adapt to plugin/adapter boundaries. citeturn8search7turn8search3

For **build systems and project evolution**, the bibliography supports the progression you propose:

- Build systems as a _design space_ (rather than incidental tooling) is directly supported by P4. citeturn0search13
- CI/CD and automation as lifecycle capability is supported both by practice‑heavy books (B13) and research‑grounded
  organisational evidence (B14). citeturn6search4turn10search6
- Determinism, auditability, and supply‑chain integrity concerns provide a modern justification for reproducible
  automation (P5). citeturn5search2
- Dependency resolution and upgrade friction (the “downstream reality” of publishing) can be grounded in package‑solver
  research (P16), giving technical depth for Unit 6 beyond “just use SemVer.” citeturn9search4

## Unit‑aligned minimal and expanded reading bundles

This section suggests **compact bundles** in terms of the codes above, so you can attach readings to each unit without
repeating titles across the syllabus narrative.

For **Unidad 1 (fundamentos, automatización, scripting)**, a minimal bundle is B13 + P4, adding P5 if you want a
security‑integrity justification for reproducible automation. citeturn6search4turn0search13turn5search2

For **Unidad 2 (problema, límites del dominio, DDD, invariantes)**, a minimal bundle is B1 + B2, with B3 as the
strongest bridge into algebraic modelling and type‑driven expression of invariants; B4 is the “formal depth” option.
citeturn4search4turn3search16turn10search3turn5search9

For **Unidad 3 (núcleo, contratos, puertos/adaptadores, API mínima)**, a minimal bundle is P1 + P2 + B7, adding P3 or B5
when you want contracts/invariants treated explicitly as a design mechanism.
citeturn0search19turn2search0turn3search21turn8search2turn7search27

For **Unidad 4 (composición, propiedades, leyes)**, a minimal bundle is P6 + P7, with P8 as the optional deepening for
structuring effects without contaminating the core (your “functional core, imperative shell” intent).
citeturn0search2turn9search29turn9search6

For **Unidad 5 (APIs expresivas, DSLs, builders, typeclasses/capacidades)**, a minimal bundle is B11 + B10, with B6 as
the “classic reusable design patterns” complement that includes Builder and Iterator as named, teachable patterns.
citeturn1search9turn5search4turn4search1

For **Unidad 6 (publicación, versionado, estabilidad, compatibilidad)**, a minimal bundle is S1 + P10, with P11–P13 as
the empirical “reality check” cluster showing how and why breakage happens and how versioning signals can fail; P14 adds
a pattern‑language framing for evolution strategies.
citeturn2search6turn12view2turn5search7turn5academia42turn5search38turn12view0

For **Unidad 7 (ejecución, extensibilidad, CI, ecosistema)**, a minimal bundle is B8 + B15, with B16/B17 as the
production‑reality pair; P15 adds contemporary empirical grounding about evolution challenges in distributed systems
(useful even if your reference project is “just a library,” because libraries increasingly live inside service
ecosystems). citeturn3search39turn6search3turn6search10turn11search5turn12view3
