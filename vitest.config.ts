// Vitest configuration used by the project.
// Notes:
// - We run tests in a jsdom environment because the site renders React components and many tests interact with DOM APIs
//   (Testing Library + jsdom).
// - `setupFiles` points to a small bootstrap that installs matchers (jest-dom) and any global test setup required by
//   the suite.
// - `globals: true` enables the familiar global test APIs (describe/it/expect) without importing them in every file. We
//   still import them in some tests for explicitness, but enabling globals keeps third-party tests simpler.
// - `css: false` disables CSS processing/transforming within Vitest. The project styles are built by the real toolchain
//   (Tailwind + Astro) and don't need to be processed during unit tests; disabling CSS speeds up test runs and avoids
//   unrelated transform errors in jsdom.

export default defineConfig({
    test: {
        // Use jsdom so DOM APIs (document/window) are available for React testing
        environment: "jsdom",

        // Run this file before the test suite to install helpers (e.g. jest-dom)
        // Path is relative to project root
        setupFiles: ["./src/test/setup.ts"],

        // Allow `describe`/`it`/`expect` as globals (optional - we still import
        // them in tests where we want explicitness)

        // Don't attempt to transform or load CSS during tests (faster + fewer errors)
