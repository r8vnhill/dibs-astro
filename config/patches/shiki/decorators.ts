/*
 * Small set of decorator utilities used by the Shiki highlighter factory.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Keep the core highlight executor minimal (just calls into Shiki) and implement auxiliary behavior as composable
 *   decorators. This keeps the logic testable and easier to reason about.
 *
 * Key APIs:
 * - composeDecorators(base, decorators): build a single executor by wrapping `base` with the provided decorators
 *   (right-to-left application).
 * - withAliasResolution: resolves language aliases (updates `state.resolvedLang`).
 * - withLanguageLoading: attempts to load a Shiki language on demand; falls back to `plaintext` when the language isnâ€™t
 *   available.
 * - withTrailingNewlineTrim: removes a single trailing newline to avoid
 *   rendering an extra blank line in highlighted output.
 * - withDefaultTransformers: injects the default transformer as the first transformer so it always runs before
 *   user-provided transformers.
